Designed for people who use their blog while travelling the planet, Weather Traveller allows you to add weather information to the bottom of your posts in an easy way. This means you can let your blog readers know what the weather is like in the location you specify at the time you post.

I got the idea from [Weather Postin'](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/weather-postin/) by Matthew Richmond.

Requires [WP Geo](http://www.benhuson.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/wp-geo/).
